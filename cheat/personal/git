# To import commits from another repo:
git --git-dir=../some_other_repo/.git format-patch -k -1 --stdout <commit SHA> | git am -3 -k

# To view commits that will be pushed:
git log @{u}..

# To view changes that are new on a feature branch:
git log -p feature --not master
git diff master...feature

# To perform an interactive rebase for the prior 7 commits:
git rebase -i @~7

# To diff files WITHOUT considering them a part of git:
# This can be used to diff files that are not in a git repo!

# To pull changes while overwriting any local commits:
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master

# To update all submodules:
git submodule update --init --recursive

# To perform a shallow clone to only get latest commits:
# (helps save data when cloning large repos)
git clone --depth 1 <remote-url>

# To unshallow a clone:
git pull --unshallow

# To create a bare branch (one that has no commits on it):
git checkout --orphan branch_name

# To checkout a new branch from a different starting point:
git checkout -b master upstream/master

# To remove all stale branches (ones that have been deleted on remote):
# So if you have a lot of useless branches, delete them on Github and then run this
git remote prune origin

# To prune all remotes at once:
git remote prune $(git remote | tr '\n' ' ')

# Revisions can also be identified with :/text
# So, this will show the first commit that has "cool" in their message body
git show :/cool

# To undo parts of last commit in a specific file
git checkout -p HEAD^ -- /path/to/file

# To revert a commit and keep the history of the reverted change as a separate revert commit:
git revert <commit SHA>

# To pick a commit from a branch to current branch. This is different than merge as
# this just applies a single commit from a branch to current branch:
git cherry-pick <commit SHA1>

# Atli: 
# Manually and interactively pick changes from a stash (or a different branch)
# into current branch
git checkout -p -i stash@{2}
